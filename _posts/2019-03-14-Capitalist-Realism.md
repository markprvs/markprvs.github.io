<h1> Capitalist Realism by Mark Fisher - A Review </h1>

<p>I read <i>Capitalist Realism</i> for the second time at the beginning of the year. The first time I read the book was shortly after I graduated from uni. I had come across references to Mark Fisher in a number of occasions, mostly from Twitter - and the length of the book meant it felt harder to justify <i>not</i> reading it (unlike the numerous books of continental philosophy that seem destined to sit in the bookcase forever). It's one of those books that feels so of its time - a time I lived through, but with no politically literacy. The impression I was left with reading the book in 2016 was one of clarity, like camera lens brought into focus. Lacking anything but a generalised anti-neoliberial disposition and a profound pessimism toward teh efficacy electoral politics, chapters on protest, education and mental health were cathartic.</p>

<p>Picking the book up again February 2019 was a different experience. At time of writing, the British establishment continues to tear itself apart over Brexit. The Labour Party, having made staggering gains in May's ill-fated snap election of 2017, sit as a government in waiting-  backed by over half a million members. The "pervasive atmosphere" of Capitalist Realism is not so thick. I now read Fisher's rage against the failings of our supposed 'betters' to address the abject failure of our current mode of production, not in a tone of frustation but of indignance, and hope.</p>

<p>Fisher died by suicide in 2017, months before Labour dismantled Theresa May's majority on the back of a manifesto with represented the first meaningful challenge to Capitalist Realism. It's not clear whether Mark would have been swept up in the europhia that engulfed many, or would have remained guarded against triumphalism and complanceny. Nevertheless, it's clear we are intellectually improvished by his absense.</p>
