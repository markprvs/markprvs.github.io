<h1>What I Read in 2019</h1>

<p>This was my first year of tracking reading, so I didn't know what to expect. I thought 12 books - 1 per month - was a reasonable goal, and in the end I exceeded this goal, reading 13. 5 self-improvement books, 4 on politics, 1 on football, 1 on business and 1 novel.</p>

<p> However, this doesn't tell the whole story. the vast majority of those books were read in the first half of year, with <i> A Little Life </i> being the only book I read and finished after September. Suprising to me was that <i>A Little Life</i> was far and away my favourite and left the largest impression on me. Nevertheless, honorable mentions go to <i>Digital Minimalism</i> and <i>Atomic Habits too</i>.</p>

<p>My main takeaways are that a) I'm a slow reader, especially with non-fiction, but I can consume full audiobooks in days, and b) I've read too few novels recently. So my goal next year is to read 36 books, at least 6 of those being fiction.</p>
