<h1>This is a list of books I have read (so far) in 2019 -and what I'm reading at the moment.</h1>

<p> I usually have a few books on the go - it makes it easier to let go of books that are not gripping me, as well as cover a few different topics.</p>

<p> Always taking recommendations - <a href="mailto:mark@markprvs.com">email</a> or <a href="https://www.twitter.com/markprvs/">tweet me</a>.
