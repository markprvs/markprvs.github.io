<h1>This is a list of books I have read (so far) in 2019 -and what I'm reading at the moment.</h1>

<p> This is intended as a live document to be updatedly regularly. I usually have a few books on the go at the moment - it makes it easier to let go of books that are not gripping me, as well as cover a few different topics</p>
